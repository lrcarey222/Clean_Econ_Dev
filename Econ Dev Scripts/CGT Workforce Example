# 0. Load libraries ----------------------------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)   # dplyr, readr, stringr, etc.

# 1. Set working directory ---------------------------------------------------
setwd("~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-RMI/")

# 2. Load Clean Growth Tool data --------------------------------------------
cgt <- readRDS(
  "~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-RMI/US Program - Documents/6_Projects/Clean Regional Economic Development/ACRE/Data/Clean-growth-project/clean_growth_toolkit_data/acre_tool_final_data.rds"
)

# 3. Extract relevant tables -------------------------------------------------
msa_data        <- cgt$msa_data
naics_msa_data  <- cgt$naics_msa_data
naics_data      <- cgt$naics_data
soc_msa_data    <- cgt$soc_msa_data
naics_soc_data  <- cgt$naics_soc_data
soc_data        <- cgt$soc_data

# 4. SOC codes to keep  ------------------------------------------------------

# 6. Identify NAICS codes tagged as “Green Buildings” ------------------------

  distinct(naics) %>%
  pull()                                # returns 8000000 in current data

# 7. Find all SOC codes linked to those NAICS codes --------------------------
green_soc_codes <- naics_soc_data %>%
  filter(naics %in% green_naics) %>%
  distinct(soc) %>%
  pull()

# 8. Assemble final Pittsburgh table ----------------------------------------
pittsburgh_green_soc_filtered <- pgh_soc_msa %>%
  # keep only SOCs that are (a) tied to Green-Building NAICS **and**
  # (b) in the user-supplied list
  filter(soc %in% green_soc_codes, soc %in% target_soc_codes) %>%

# 9. View / export results ---------------------------------------------------
